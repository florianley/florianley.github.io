== Asciidoc

This blog is fully developed throughout https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/#what-is-asciidoc[Asciidocs ]files and compiled with https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]. Ascidoctor is an open source project useful to convert plain text files (Asciidoc files) content to HTML5, PDF and other formats.

With Acsidoc you can easily create documentation linked to your development projects.
Gitlab include automatic processors witch display  your documentation directly in your repository. For this website, HTML documentation are processed locally with https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] and published thanks to https://pages.github.com/[GitHubPages]

=== Processing

Asciidoctor reads and parses text written in the AsciiDoc syntax, then feeds the parse tree to a set of built-in converters to produce HTML5, DocBook 5, and man(ual) page output. You have the option of using your own converter or loading Tilt-supported templates to customize the generated output or produce additional formats.
